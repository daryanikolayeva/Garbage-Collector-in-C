# Garbage Collector (C)

🧹 A simplified memory management system written in C that simulates a basic garbage collector using the mark-and-sweep algorithm.

## 🔍 Problem Solved

Built to understand low-level memory control by implementing a basic garbage collection system from scratch — simulating how memory is allocated, tracked, and reclaimed.
